# Personal Travel Blog on IBM Cloud Static Web Apps

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a personal travel blog hosted on IBM Cloud Static Web Apps. This travel blog aims to inspire and inform readers about travel adventures while delivering valuable tips and captivating photographs.

## Technologies Used

The Travel Blog project utilizes the following technologies:

- *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:* These fundamental web technologies are used for structuring the content, styling the website, and adding interactivity.

- *Bootstrap:* The Bootstrap framework is employed for responsive design and pre-designed components.

- *IBM Cloud Object Storage:* The static web app is deployed to IBM Cloud Object Storage, making it accessible on the web.

- *Browser Developer Tools:* These tools are invaluable for testing and debugging the project during development.

- *Visual Studio Code:* A popular code editor for web development.

- *Git:* Version control system for managing code.

## Hosting on IBM Cloud Static Web Apps

### Purpose

The purpose of hosting on IBM Cloud Static Web Apps is to ensure the availability and scalability of the blog with secure hosting.

### Technical Implementation

Here's how to set up your project on IBM Cloud Static Web Apps:

1. *Sign up for an IBM Cloud account* if you haven't already.

2. *Create a new Static Web App* on IBM Cloud and configure it to host the blog.

3. *Enable SSL certification* for secure access to the blog.

4. *Test the hosting environment* for performance and reliability.
