        <h1>About Madurai</h1>
      
<p>
    Madurai is known for its rich cultural heritage, magnificent temples, and vibrant festivals. The most famous landmark of the city is the Meenakshi Amman Temple, which is dedicated to Goddess Meenakshi, a form of Parvati, and Lord Sundareshwar, a form of Lord Shiva. The temple complex is massive and is known for its intricate carvings and sculptures.
</p>

<h2>History of Madurai</h2>
<p>
    Important to keep in mind is that before Madurai was built on the banks of the Vaigai River, there was a forest known as Kadambavanam. There are few written accounts of the real circumstances that led to the construction of the magnificent metropolis.
</p>
<p>
    Madurai was founded when Dhananjaya, a farmer, happened upon Lord Indra, monarch of the gods, as he strolled through the forest on a glorious day, praising the lingam installed beneath a Kadamba tree. As soon as the word cutter learned of the catastrophe, he informed Kulasekara Pandiyan, king of the Pandyan Empire. After the religious monarch gave orders to clear the woodlands, his attendants erected a temple around the lingam.
